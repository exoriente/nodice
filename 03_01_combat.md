# Combat

## Resolution

The combatant with the highest score wins. If the difference between the combat levels is three or more the combat is resolved at the end of the same round. If the difference is less than three, the combat is resolved at the end of the scene. Such a situation is called *prolonged combat* and the combatants cannot disengage without risking life and limb. Combat lock is resolved only at the end of combat or when other characters intervne or other events influencing the balance. Then the situation is evaluated anew.

### Pressing back

Often, during prolonged combat, the combatant with the lower combat level is driven backwards by their attacker. Whether or not this happens is up to the combatant with the highest score. They can decide to press their opponent back or not. If they do, each round of combat will move the combatant with the upper hand 5 feet forward and forces their opponent back 5 feet. This continues until the balance of combat changes or until the underdog cannot be pressed back further due to reaching a wall or other obstacle. Fighting with their back against a wall will give a combatant a combat penalty, so when this happens, it might trigger immediate resolution, if this means the underdog becomes outclassed.

Driving combatants back is possible in ganging up scenarios. Multiple warrior might drive a dangerous moster back, or the other way around. Whether driving back is possible is up to the storyteller.

If big creatures are involved the distance driven back may be scaled up to match the size of the combatants with the upper hand.

### Bonuses and penalties

- `-1` : Fighting with your back to a wall or other obstacle
- `-2` : Fighting with your back to a precipice or similarly dangerous feature of your environment

## Ganging up

If multiple assailants fight against a single foe, their effective combat level is based on combat level of the strongest in the group. Each additional combatant increases the combat level by one. If this results in an opponent being defeated, the attacker with the highest combat level typically deals the final blow.

## Missile combat

### Firing into melee

When a character fires on an enemy that is already engaged in melee combat, the rules for ganging up apply, considering the attackers using melee weapons and missile weapons as a single force. This rule applies even if the target's other opponents are not allies of the one using the missile attack. This rule also applies to multiple attackers using missile weapons against a single target.

If the combined combat level is three or more higher that the target's combat level, the attack is effective in the same round, killing or knocking out the target, depending on the weapons used. If the combat level of the attacker less, the missile attack had little effect, other than making the moment more difficult for the target. More advantage is needed to make the attack effective.

### Bonuses and penalties

- `+0` : If the target expects your missile attack, even if they are in melee combat
- `+1` : If the target is not anticipating your missile attack, but does expect missile attacks in a general sense
- `+2` : If the target is not expecting any missile attack
- `+3` : If the target is not expecting any attack whatsoever

### Firing on a target that is not in combat

If outclassed the target is defeated in the same round. If the attacker and defender measure up the attack effectively becomes suppresive fire. The target must block the projectile or take cover and loses his action that round. If the target outclasses the attacker, they can ignore the missile attack completely. Suppresive fire can stop the target from moving, casting spells or take any other action. When under fire you can still fire back, attack another target, or take cover. Cover might decrease the attackers effective missile combat skill enough to allow you to ignore his attack.

### Cover

- `+âˆž` : Behind full hard cover
- `+3` : Behind full hard cover, but taking action that forces you to momentarily expose yourself
- `+2` : Behind partial hard cover
- `+2` : Obscured but no hard cover (bushes, leaves)

## Save points

Spend a save point to ignore the consequences of an attack. This will allow you to:

- Ignore an attack with major advantage
- Escape from tied combat
- Ignore suppresive fire

## Complications

### Pairing up

In most cases it will be obvious to all players which combatants are fighting who and how to compare their combat levels. But in some cases this can get complicated, if combatants are attacking one another in complicated configurations.

For example:

- The fimir wants to attack the barbarian
- The barbarians want to attack the orc, to protect the wizard
- The orc wants to attack the wizard
- The wizard is just trying to defend herself

So are the barbarian and the wizard ganging up on the orc? Or is the orc, since it must defend against the barbarian, forced to fight him and effectively ganging up with the fimir?

To resolve these and more complicated situations assign pairs by order of highest combat level first. This can force combatants to face opponents they do not prefer to fight.

To continue the example, the first combat pairing is decided by the barbarian, who has the highest combat level in this case (4). He means to attack the orc, who has combat level 2, so the orc is pulled into combat by the barbarian and does not get to pick his fight.

The fimir is next at combat level 3. Because they want to kill the barbarian, the fimir is ganging up with the orc on the barbarian.

The orc does not get to choose, being forced into defending himself against the barbarian's onslaught.

The wizard, with combat level 1, lends a hand by attacking the orc. This means she is joining the fight on the barbarian's side.

So effectively it's the orc and the fimir together against the combined force of the wizard and the...

## Using weapons and armor

Weapons and armor can give great advantage in combat if combined with the right training on how to use them. This counts not only for weapons, but also for armor. Exploiting armor effectively in combat requires knowledge, skill and training. Even without such training having at least some weapon is critical when fighting armed opponents.

- `-3` : Unarmed and opposed by at least one armed opponent

Wearing armor does count as being armed and does not negate this penalty. If you are fighting multiple opponents at the same time, only one of them needs to be armed for you to suffer this penalty.

Note that this penalty does not extend to all unarmed combatants in the same fight. Other opponents that are unarmed will not suffer this penalty just because they are fighting side by side with an armed ally. Only if they face an armed opponent themselves will it go into effect.

This penalty can be prevented by wielding any weapon that can be used to parry or keep an enemy at distance.

- `+0` : Using light weapon (dagger, short sword, hand axe)

### Weapon and armor bonuses

Heavy weapons designed for killing, or at least maiming, present and advantage in combat, so does wearing armor and using shields. They following bonuses reflect this advantage. However, they can only be used fully by trained warriors.

- `+1` : Using one heavy weapon (sword, axe, spear, etc) 
- `+2` : Using two-handed weapon
- `+1` : Using two light weapons
- `+2` : Using two weapons, at least one heavy
- `+1` : Using shield
- `+1` : Wearing light armor
- `+2` : Wearing heavy armor

If you are not trained in any way, you cannot get more that a +1 bonuses for any of the above advantages.

If you are trained for any of them, you can apply those when appropriate. Any additional advantage that applies, but that you are not trained for can give you an additional +1 at most.

Examples:

> Princess Vulnera wants to pull her weight in the defense of kingdom. She puts on leather armor (`+1`), takes a long sword (`+1`) and a shield (`+1`) and joins the ranks of battle, without being trained on how to us any of them. She gets a total combat bonus of only `+1`.

> Croogrin the goblin is trained to fight with a spear (`+1`) and shield (`+1`). He readies himself to fight the troll that has been invading his territory and puts on the only armor he can find. A heavy chain mail suit (`+2`). Since he has `heavy weapon training` and `shield training` he can get a `+2` bonus to his combat level. But since he does not have `heavy armor training` the chain mail and any other equipment advantage can give him at most an additional `+1` bonus. His total combat bonus is `+3`.

### Attacks ignoring armor

This rule plays well with ganging up rules:

- A character using an attack that is not affected by armor gets a bonus equal to the armor bonus of the target.

This way the right comparison is made even when ganging up.

## Other bonuses

- `+3` : Surprise attack from behind

## Kill threat

Happens when knife is held at throat, enough archers are aiming at character, etc. More of a story device that a combat situation, but combat can end with a kill threat if someone gets in a position for it. Level of the threatening force must be high enough relative to threatened character (at least half)?

## Defeat

### Consequences of losing in a fight

|                    | armed combat | unarmed combat |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| main character     | wounded, possibly unconscious, certainly out of action | stunned, possibly knocked out |
| extra              | killed       | knocked out    |


### Wounded

A wounded character has suffered a significant injury. It requires attention and deserves story time to deal with it. Until the injury has healed or has been statisfactorily treated a character is typically out of action, but might still interact socially.

If a lead character has been wounded, the situation can be resolved by playing out three scenes that revolve around the situation, preferably involving three separate PCs. Examples:

- A desperate attempt to give first aid to the wounded character
- A heart-to-heart between to characters about their concern over their wounded friend
- An angry outburst by a character about the incompetence of the characters or others involved that lead to the injury

For supporting characters one such scene is sufficient.

Possible complications:

- The character has been mortally injured and needs help quickly
- There are no supplies available to sufficiently treat the character

These and other complication can be introduced by the storyteller if he considers them worthwhile additions to the story.

### Death

Happens to extras all the time.

Main cast death should always be a special event.
