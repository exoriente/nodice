# Advancement

## Rising in level

Happens whenever the storyteller feels like it. He does neet to game an experience point system to make it happen. Typically happens as reward after completing one or more adventures.

### Increase skills

All skills are recalculated with the new character level.

### Increase powers

A character starts out with 3 powers and learn 1 extra power each level.

### Learning spells

It's easier for a magic user to gain spells than powers, but it still requires practice and training to use most magic spells. Instead of learning 1 power a magic user can learn 2 spells.

## Learning when not advancing in level

When the story leads to a character learning a new power or spell as a result of events in the game, don't wait until the character actually advances in level to allow them to use it. Use one of the following options.

### Learn now, pay later

The character just learns the power or spells and can use it right away. The next time they rise in level they'll will have to acquire it the regular way.

### Advance immediately

Encountering an opportunity to learn something new, like learning from a sword master or decyphering the inscription in the ruined temple, can be a momentous occasion. Consider letting the character or characters advance to the next level on the spot. The fact that they encounter such opportunity for growth is a good indication for level advancement that fits well with the story.
