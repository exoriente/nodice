# Stealth

## New idea

- Major advantage: pass effortlessly
- Minor advantage: slow pass but alert level / suspicion of guards is raised, increasing difficilty next time
- Equal advantage / minor disadvantage: no pass, slow retreat possible, alert / suspicion raised
- Major disadvantage: immediate detection

### Increased alertness / suspicion

Can be bonus to detection +1 or +2

Can also mean measures: more patrols, closing gates etc.

## General rule

The outcome of an attempt at stealth is determined by comparing the stealth levels of characters or comparing a character's stealth level to a stealth difficulty level as posed by traps, locks or other devices.

### Outclassed

Stealth user outclasses: stealth is fully succesful and can be done quickly
Stealth user outclassed: stealth immediately fails and is detected

### Measuring up

If stealth level of stealth user is higher, stealth can still be succesfully performed, but will take entire scene to succesfully execute.

If stealth level of user is lower, stealh user noticed in time that stealth will not be succesful and can abort, however this still takes a scene in total.

## Using stealth as a group

Stealth is a solitary expertise and does not lend itself well to group actions. However, the guidance of an experienced stealth user can be of benefit. When attempting stealth with two or more characters the group's stealth level is equal to that of the lowest stealth level of all individuals in the group. If there is character in the group that outclasses the worst stealth user, the group's stealth level is raised by one.

### Preparing an ambush

If there is time to prepare and everyone is willing and able to follow the instruction of stealth user of higher skill, a group can prepare an ambush with a higher stealth level than the above group rules allow. Each hidden character's effective stealth level is equal to the average of their own stealth level and that of the instructing stealth user's level, rounded up. This bonus is only effective when hidden as instructed. As soon as any characters comes out of hiding or is detected they can no longer make use of this bonus.
 
## Modifiers

- `+1` : Clothes and equipment prepared for stealth
- `+2` : Clothes and equipment designed for stealth
- `-3` : Picking pockets without help of distraction (crowd, collision, etc)

## Detecting traps

The storyteller determines the difficulty of each trap. If a characters stealth level outclasses the difficulty level of the trap, the character will easily spot it, even when moving at a normal pace.

If the character's stealth level measures up it means they will detect the trap only when they are moving slowly and are actively searching for traps.
