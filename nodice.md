## Glossary

#### Player characters

#### Non-player characters

#### Lead character

#### Main cast

An important character in the story that has a name and is intended to feature in more than one session. All PCs are agonists, and typically protagonists, to be specific. Most important NPCs that recur in multiple sessions are agonists as well.

The pricipal characteristic of agonists is that they follow the same rules as player characters with respect to save points and combat.

#### Extra

A throw-away character that is typically not named and has no long term relevance in the story past a scene or session. Enemy hordes, anonymous henchmen, innocent bystanders and the like are typically anagonists. Most rules apply to them, but combat rules are typically simplified to handle larger numbers of them more easily.

#### Outclassing

Compared levels are three or more apart

#### Measuring up

Compared levels are less than three apart

---

## Classes

Main skill is equal to level. Rest is equal to half level, rounded down.

## Skills

- Combat : Warrior
- Magic : Wizard
- Stealth : Thief
- Interaction : Bard
- Proficiency

### Magic

Only wizards can use magic. Other characters still have magic levels equal to half their character level, but use that only to compare against a wizards power when resisting magic or defending against it.

### Proficiency

This is a general skill used for any aspect of life not included in the other skills. There is no class defined for this skill.

## Combat

### Resolution

The combatant with the highest score wins. If the difference between the combat levels is three or more the combat is resolved at the end of the same round. If the difference is less than three, the combat is resolved at the end of the scene. Such a situation is called *tied combat* and the combatants cannot disengage without risking life and limb. Combat lock is resolved only at the end of combat or when other characters intervne or other events influencing the balance. Then the situation is evaluated anew.

### Ganging up

If multiple assailants fight against a single foe, their effective combat level is based on combat level of the strongest in the group. Each additional combatant increases the combat level by one. If this results in an opponent being defeated, the attacker with the highest combat level typically deals the final blow.

### Missile combat

#### Firing into melee

When a character fires on an enemy that is already engaged in melee combat, the rules for ganging up apply, considering the attackers using melee weapons and missile weapons as a single force. This rule applies even if the target's other opponents are not allies of the one using the missile attack. This rule also applies to multiple attackers using missile weapons against a single target.

If the combined combat level is three or more higher that the target's combat level, the attack is effective in the same round, killing or knocking out the target, depending on the weapons used. If the combat level of the attacker less, the missile attack had little effect, other than making the moment more difficult for the target. More advantage is needed to make the attack effective.

#### Bonuses and penalties

- `+0` : If the target expects your missile attack, even if they are in melee combat
- `+1` : If the target is not anticipating your missile attack, but does expect missile attacks in a general sense
- `+2` : If the target is not expecting any missile attack
- `+3` : If the target is not expecting any attack whatsoever

#### Firing on a target that is not in combat

If outclassed the target is defeated in the same round. If the attacker and defender measure up the attack effectively becomes suppresive fire. The target must block the projectile or take cover and loses his action that round. If the target outclasses the attacker, they can ignore the missile attack completely. Suppresive fire can stop the target from moving, casting spells or take any other action. When under fire you can still fire back, attack another target, or take cover. Cover might decrease the attackers effective missile combat skill enough to allow you to ignore his attack.

#### Cover

- `+âˆž` : Behind full hard cover
- `+3` : Behind full hard cover, but taking action that forces you to momentarily expose yourself
- `+2` : Behind partial hard cover
- `+2` : Obscured but no hard cover (bushes, leaves)

### Save points

Spend a save point to ignore the consequences of an attack. This will allow you to:

- Ignore a critical attack and escape
- Escape from tied combat
- Ignore suppresive fire

### Defeat

#### Consequences of losing in a fight

|                    | armed combat | unarmed combat |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| main character     | wounded, possibly unconscious, certainly out of action | stunned, possibly knocked out |
| extra              | killed       | knocked out    |


#### Wounded

A wounded character has suffered a significant injury. It requires attention and deserves story time to deal with it. Until the injury has healed or has been statisfactorilly treated a character is typically out of action, but might still interact socially.

If a lead character has been wounded, the situation can be resolved by playing out three scenes that revolve around the situation, preferably involving three separate PCs. Examples:

- A desperate attempt to give first aid to the wounded character
- A heart-to-heart between to characters about their concern over their wounded friend
- An angry outburst by a character about the incompetence of the characters or others involved that lead to the injury

For supporting characters one such scene is sufficient.

Possible complications:

- The character has been mortally injured and needs help quickly
- There are no supplies available to sufficiently treat the character

These and other complication can be introduced by the storyteller if he considers them worthwhile additions to the story.
