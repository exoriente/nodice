# Combat Complications

## Touch attacks


## Special attacks

Characters gang up, but they work together to have one character's attack hit their enemy, because that attack has a special effect that is the outcome desired by the characters.

Base combat level is of strongest character that has special attack. Other characters, including stronger ones, give +1 bonus.
