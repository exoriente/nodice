# Combat Complications

## Going all out

In some situations, a main character might decide to go all out in combat, to give it their all and to hold nothing back. Anger, desperation, the desire or need to sacrifice oneself all may contribute to this fateful decision.

This strategy has the following effects:

- The combat level of the character is raised with a `+4` bonus
- The character loses all save points, if they had any left
- Victory in combat means the character is down and wounded (as if they had been defeated), while defeat means death
- Going all out lasts until the fight the character is in is resolved and can't be ended before that

This strategy results in an ominous increase in stakes, but only for the character using it. The other characters or creatures in the fight suffer the normal consequences of defeat and have no adverse effect when winning it.

Note that that this power is only available for main characters. Extras never go all out, except in colorful descriptions of how they fight and die, without the game effects above available to them. However, the storyteller can break this rule if story and circumstance demand it, but an extra that rises above the ranks like that can be considered promoted to main cast almost by definition.

### Going all out against main characters

Players must realize that going all out against a superior main cast enemy is quite dangerous. Even if the +4 bonus is enough to defeat them, the enemy has the option to go all out as well, restoring the original balance. However, they will not do that by default, as it means being wounded and out of combat even if they are victorious. In many cases this will be too high a price to pay for victory and using a save point to retreat might be the better option.


## Touch attacks


## Special attacks

Characters gang up, but they work together to have one character's attack hit their enemy, because that attack has a special effect that is the outcome desired by the characters.

Base combat level is of strongest character that has special attack. Other characters, including stronger ones, give +1 bonus.
