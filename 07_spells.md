### Fireball

- `Sorcery`
- `Level 5`

Caster fires small fiery orb at any target. It explodes in a ball of hellish flame. Radius is 15 feet. All creatures inside radius are attacked with kill power equal to magical power of caster. All combat is interupted except those who dominate.

Fireball can cause fires and immolates most flammable objects in radius. It does not typically set living creatures on fire.
