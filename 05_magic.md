# Magic

## Casting power

The maximum casting power of a magic user is equal to his magic level. However, a caster can always use less casting power to cast a spell, to consciously diminish the spell's effect.

## Cool down

Not all spells can be cast repetitively without consequence. Those that can't have a cool down clause specifying how often they can be cast again.

### Energy burnout

Some spells, especially sorceries, require the expenditure of great amount raw magical power to cast. These drain the caster and such a spell can only be cast once per scene. Moreover once a caster suffers energy burnout, they cannot cast any other spell that scene that also cause energy burnout.

#### Ignoring energy burnout

A caster can ignore energy burnout and cast another energy consuming spell regardless. This taxes the caster to the extreme and knocks them out for the rest of the scene.

#### Preventing energy burnout

A caster can prevent a spell from causing energy burnout by using half his casting power or less, rounded down, to cast the spell.
