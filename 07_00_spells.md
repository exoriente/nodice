### Fireball

- `Sorcery`
- `Level 5`

Caster fires small fiery orb at any target. It explodes in a ball of hellish flame. Radius is 15 feet. All creatures inside radius are attacked with spell power equal to casting power. All combat is interupted except those whose combat level dominates the spell power level.

Fireball can cause fires and immolates most flammable objects in radius. It does not typically set living creatures on fire.

Causes the caster to suffer energy burnout.
