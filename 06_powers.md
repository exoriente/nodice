# Powers

## Character creation powers

These powers can be selected at character creation only.

### Large

*Me kill little human*

You are of a race larger and stronger than a demihuman. +1 on melee combat.

You are as strong as a demihuman that has the `strong` power, unless you also have the `strong` power, making you relatively strong even for your size.

-1 on melee combat in cramped spaces

### Fast

*You call that running?*

You can cover more ground in a combat round and you can easily catch up with anyone who is not fast, reach things before they do or escape without them catching up.

### Stealth boost

*Guess who?*

You are naturally adept at stealth. Your base stealth skill is higher. The exact level depends on your class stealth skill.

| Class stealth level | Boosted stealth level |
|:----:|:--------:|
| x0   | x1/3     |
| x1/3 | x1/2     |
| x1/2 | x2/3     |
| x2/3 | x2/3 + 2 |
| x1   | x1 + 2   |

### Natural weapons

*Rawr!*

Your body has natural weapons, such as claws and teeth, that are significantly more lethal than those of a typical demihuman. If you use them without additional weapons against an armed opponent, your penalty is -1 instead of -3. You can also readily wound and kill people in unarmed combat.

### Enhanced smell

*You can smell everyting... for better or worse*

You have a nose like a blood hound. This gives you a +2 bonus on tracking, detecting stealth and to negate the penalty of acting in the dark.
