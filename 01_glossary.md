## Player character

A character played by a dedicated player. Normally each player, except for the storyteller, plays one player character exclusively.

## Non-player character

Character played by the storyteller (even though they are also playing). Typically supporting cast or extras, but important non-player characters can be part of the lead cast as well.

## Lead character

The lead casts consist of the protagonists. Typically these are the player characters, but important and frequently played NPCs can also be considered lead cast.

## Main cast

An important character in the story that has a name and is intended to feature in more than one session. All PCs are main cast, as well as any other lead characters. Important NPCs that recur in multiple sessions are main cast as well.

The pricipal characteristic of main cast is that they follow the same rules as player characters with respect to save points and combat.

## Extra

A throw-away character that is typically not named and has no long term relevance in the story past a scene or session. Enemy hordes, anonymous henchmen, innocent bystanders and the like are typically extras. Combat rules are simplified to handle larger numbers of extras more easily.
